/*
The client program for this application creates a running media list to be filtered by the user. 
It displays the filters in use and possible filters that can be used for the data, as well as the data from the file
that satisfies the filter.
The user may continually add or remove filters from the filter list. Each time this operation is performed, the media list is updated
and the new media list satisfying all filters is printed.
The user may end the program by entering 'exit' as the command.
