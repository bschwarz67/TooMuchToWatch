This is a project I did for the Fall 2018 semester at University of Memphis titled "Too Much To Watch."
The program reads and parses a textfile containig information on movies in Tv shows, stores this data in objects,
and puts the objects into a linkedlist. It allows the user to filter the list based on contraints such as date and 
rating.

To test:

-import to an IDE and run the client
-enter this line of input to filter out movies/shows made after 1923: 'add year < 1924'

expected output:

"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""
Charlie Chaplin Collection series 3.7 1914-1914
Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde movie 3.1 1920
Intolerance movie 3.2 1916
Our Hospitality movie 3.6 1923
The Birth of a Nation movie 2.9 1915
The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari movie 3.7 1919
The Golem movie 3.2 1920

Number of items that match the current filter list: 7
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""


filters that may be input as a command:

'genre' '=' 'series'
'genre' '=' 'movie'
'title' '=' ''
'year' '>' ''
'year' '<' ''
'rating' '>' ''
'rating' '<' ''
